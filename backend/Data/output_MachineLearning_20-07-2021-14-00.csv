Im currently working with a very high dimensional data set of dimensions \~ 84,000 \* 190,000. The response variable is categorical with 9 levels and is quite imbalanced. Further, the predictors are very sparse, i.e. the vast majority of predictors are 0 for any given observation. I'm looking to develop a strong predictive model with this data but am at a bit of a loss as to what models /techniques to use.

Currently I'm using SVD (non-centered to preserve sparse matrix format of predictors) to reduce dimensions of predictors and have been experimenting with OVR logistic regression with/without penalties and random forests on the SVD components. I've heard SVCs can be good for these kinds of problems but my results using OVR SVCs have been disappointing (below zero R accuracy).

Would love to hear any/all suggestions on what models might provide accurate classification on this data.

Thanks very much",1626750871.0

My currently design choice is encode the HPO code (symptoms) into one hot vector and use a machine learning algorithm (random forest, for example). The training set could look something like this



Text| HPO1(headache)| HPO2(nausea)| HPO3(coughing)| ...| ...| HPO30000(rash on skin)| labels

I feel like using dimensionality reduction (like PCA) will not be good because all columns are important.

In the context of multi-objective optimization of non-blackbox functions, I read about some methods called ""scalarization"" which effectively transform multi-objective optimization problems into single-objective optimization problems.

For example: If you are trying to optimize three cost functions F1, F2, F3 ... you could combine these into a single problem using weighted coefficients, e.g. T = A * F1 + B* F2 + C *F3

A popular way to solve the above equation is to use methods like ""epsilon-constraint"": This is where you apply the desired constraints to F1, F2, F3 ... and then instruct the computer to loop through different values of A, B, C. Then, you see which combination of parameters (used in F1, F2, F3) result in the minimization of ""T"" - this is much easier to compare, since you can just rank all the candidate solutions. (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc9NwvlpEpI)

This leads me to my question:

1) Do methods like ""epsilon constraint"" apply to ""Blackbox"" Functions? I.e. Can you use the ""epsilon constraint"" method along with the genetic algorithm?

2) Intuitively, when dealing with a multi-objective optimization problem: is there any way to deal with all the solutions along the ""Pareto Front""? Using the concept of the ""Pareto Front"" - suppose the optimization algorithm identifies a set of solutions that ""can not be made better in some criteria without worsening some other criteria"" ... how exactly can you rank and compare all the solutions along the Pareto Front? The concept of scalarization seemed useful, seeing how it converts a multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective optimization problem, and therefore you can rank all the candidate solutions according to the ones that result in the minimum cost of the single objective .... but otherwise, how are you supposed to pick a solution among the set of solutions along the Pareto Front?

We all  probably know the importance of the gradient descent algorithm within the domain of machine learning (e.g. calculating the weights for neural networks) - but not all of have studied the inner details behind the gradient descent algorithm.

For instance, I was looking at this ""proof of convergence"" for the gradient descent algorithm over here: https://imgur.com/a/r7jRcPJ 

1) Just to clarify - in this case, does ""convergence"" mean it will necessarily reach some ""minimum"" (whether ""local"" or ""global"") point after k iterations? 

Or does it mean it mean that ""differences in the k-1 and k iteration will be negligible""? (I am not sure if this statement is characteristic of a ""minimum"" point? i.e the difference between the k-1 and k iteration is ONLY negligible when you reach some sort of minimum point?)

2) for a real-world dataset and choice of algorithm that uses gradient descent, is it ever possible to ""approximate"" the value of k in advance? could you ever (hypothetically) say that ""for this problem, I will approximately need to run gradient descent N number of times before I can reach an error of 0.2?""? (is this strong convergence or convergence in probability?)

3) are the performance results from an algorithm that uses gradient descent ever ""guaranteed within a certain error bound outside of the data it was exposed to""? or is this just wishful thinking?

4) https://imgur.com/a/r7jRcPJ in this picture, in the numerator on the term on the right hand side, do the ""two 2's stacked on each other"" refer to ""squared"" and ""l2 norm""?

if anyone has any other insights they would like to share on the ""importance of convergence for gradient descent"", please feel free to do so!

Mainly in context-specific areas such as finance, traffic, energy, etc, seems like every congress you attend for more than half of the publications are like this: ""So we have these datasets that have been feed to this exotic DL architecture. Our results excel the state of the art in a 0.1%. That is our contribution.""

I understand that it is an easy way to publish a paper as this kind of modeling technique is a hot topic right now. However, in my research context (which can be defined as 'traffic state prediction') can be disadvantageous. In a recent paper ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02260](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02260)), we demonstrate that for a time series prediction approach, where data is self-descriptive (meaning that as a human being you can easily interpret the current values of the series) DL architectures do not overperform another less computational demandant algorithms such as the *all mighty* Random Forest.

The core idea behind this investigation is to shed light on an overlooked issue in this field: researchers apply modeling techniques without considering the endemic characteristics of their data collection:

* Is your data self-descriptive? 
* Is your data Euclidean?
* Are you going to benefit from the data fusion capabilities of DL?

So I see many AA papers do additional experiment with black-box attacks.

However, I also am aware that the black-box attacks are not effective on the defensive methods using stochastic factors (injecting random noise to input image, weights or intermediate states ...), but I don't remember the source of it.

I see some papers using random factors as defense do not perform black-box attacks. For example, those two recent papers, [Adv-BNN: Improved Adversarial Defense through Robust Bayesian Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01279) (Bayesian model with stochastic sampling) and [Simulating a Primary Visual Cortex at the Front of CNNs Improves Robustness to Image Perturbations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.154542v1.full.pdf) (injecting noise to input image), they don't do any black-box attack. I am not fully confident of the reason why they didn't do black-box attack, but I guess the reason is that their model is utilizing randomness inside.

&#x200B;

I think doing black-box attack is necessary to make sure if it is not from gradient obfuscation even for defenses with randomness. Otherwise, how do one knows if the robustness is due to obfuscation or not?

I just want to know your thought on performing black-box attacks on defensive models with randomness. As those papers I posted did not do black-box attack, do you think it is not necessary to do black-box attack for stochastic defensive methods? (Maybe the reason for those works do not perform black-box attack is not what I expect.)

If you know any paper perform black-box attacks on stochastic defensive method, could you let me know? I want to know the proper way of doing black-box attack on stochastic defensive methods. ",1626724665.0

I am trying to figure out the pros and cons of splitting the dataset into two subsets, pre-training separate networks on each, and then training them in tandem on a subset of the full dataset.

I am thinking the following:

* The network trained on the uniformly distributed data can gain high accuracy while working with a randomly sampled subset of the corresponding sub-dataset. This could decrease the overall training time since I will feed less data into that specific network.
* Fusing and re-training the networks on a *subset* of the full dataset should resemble a network training on the full dataset while retaining its overall distribution. We can assume the networks are performing well on the sub-datasets, so fusing them should retain the correct overall distribution while reducing training time.
* My network will use L1 or L2 loss. If I train on a lot on uniformly-distributed samples, the network will tend to converge towards this value. Not sure I can do anything about this though unless I alter the overall data distribution.

I am unsure how to properly formulate the idea and appreciate any clarifications or keywords suggestions.

Here are a few examples that hopefully capture the idea:

Example 1:

In number recognition (NMIST) the typical setup would be.  

You provide a 100x100 pixel input.  Each pixel is grayscaled and you feed it to your ML algorithm.  

Implicit in this ML algorithm is that you know for certain your input value (each pixel) with confidence of 1.  

What if you do not know with high confidence the pixel value?  ie: I say this pixel is White, but only have 0.8 confidence?  Shouldn't that influence my final output? 

Say I have an input picture where all my confidence in the pixels is really low, even though the output is 8  the confidence of the 8 should be really low.

Example 2:

I want to figure out if it will rain.  I input a lot of variables, such as ""morning cloud cover"", ""morning temperature"", ""time of year"" etc.  However the variable ""morning cloud cover"" is highly variable.  Saying 50% is not exactly true.  It is more a range of values, \[30%, 60%\].  

Maybe I can input 50% with range of 10% into the ML?

Example 3:

You have collected some data, and implicit to this data is really high noise.  Both in what you are measuring and in the final output.  You know that the uncertainty in the input for any given variable is really high.  Or perhaps the 95% confidence is very wide.  What is the best way to capture this idea?

&#x200B;

My current thoughts:

I am unclear what to search online.  ""uncertainty input parameters machine learning"" is a very crappy set of keywords to search.

I believe that even when you have a lot of samples to train with, this problem of ""uncertain inputs"" persists and should affect your final output. 

Any thoughts appreciated or even how to approach this problem.",1626684567.0

A well known approach is to use self-supervised pretraining such as state-of-the art contrastive methods that are trained to reduce the distance between representation of augmented views of the same image (positive pairs) and increasing the distance between representations of augmented views of different images. These methods need careful treatment of negative pairs, whereas **BYOL achieves higher performance than SOTA contrastive methods without using negative pairs** at all. Instead it uses two networks that learn from each other to iteratively bootstrap the representations by forcing one network to use an augmented view of an image to predict the output of the other network for a different augmented view of the same image.

I have a hard time understanding a softmax problem from the book:

ln(a\^L\_j) = z\^L\_j - ln(sum(exp(z\^L\_k))). Then, z\^L\_j = ln(a\^L\_j) + ln(sum(exp(z\^L\_k)))

https://imgur.com/a/UmXTQ64

I understand that usually in multi objective optimization problems, since there are so many criteria to be optimized - it is very unlikely to have a ""globally best"" solution. Usually, some solutions will be better in some of the criteria - and other solutions will be better in other criteria. For example, if you are trying to find airplane tickets and want to optimize cost/length of flight : it is very likely some tickets will be expensive and short, some tickets will be cheap and long, and some tickets will be in the middle.

But suppose the data is such - sometimes, we can stumble across a ticket that is both cheap and short. Thus, in this case - how does the concept of the Pareto Front apply over here? The Pareto Front would usually refer to a group of airplane tickets that ""cannot be improved in any of the objectives without degrading at least one of the other objectives"" ( source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization). But suppose there was one airplane ticket that was both cheaper AND shorter than any other ticket - in this example, would the Pareto Front simply be made of this one ""supreme point""?

Also, this must happen sometimes in real life - correct?

2. f must be a smooth function

Assume I want to learn a normalizing flow between a Poisson and a Normal distribution.  
 If I discretize my Normal distribution, both have an infinite support,  i.e., the same number of support elements and hence, I can find an  invertible mapping between them (another option would be to consider  only the first n natural numbers for the Poisson distribution and also  select n elements from the Normal distribution).

Moreover, when I am training a Normalizing Flow on my computer, I never have *continuous*  data - instead, I have discrete samples from my distribution.

We are about to publish a paper that found a strong predictive correlation between memes and deltas on equities ( GME, AMC, Crypto etc). As we want to analyze this on a larger scale for a longer time Periode, we are putting the code into production letting it run for a long time to further study the impact. As I am the only engineer currently active involved in the Project, we are looking for someone with experience in ML Engineering and cloud services. We are a team of a php student in Statistics and the professor of the department of statistics at the university of Augsburg. We are planning to keep on publishing papers about that and have multiple Deep-Learning projects at hand. I am putting around 10 hours a week into the project, so manageable time. We are also studying image classification models on chart movements for some of the predictions. 
So what’s in if you wanna join. 

- become Co Author in our papers to come 
- studying a very new phenomenon 
- getting hands on experience with DL/ML, Stats, MLops and Cloud solutions. 
- work with highly motivated people 
- and who knows, maybe we are becoming the next Jim Simons ( this was sarcasm) 

Just drop me a PM or comment and I set up a meeting. I would be very happy to find some motivate humans from anywhere !",1626585382.0

Hello, I am writing to inform you about the release of Parallelformers ([https://github.com/tunib-ai/parallelformers](https://github.com/tunib-ai/parallelformers)), a model parallelization library at TUNiB. Parallelformers is a toolkit that supports inference parallelism for 68 of 70 models in Huggingface Transformers with 1 line of code.

Previously, DeepSpeed-Inference was used as a parallelization toolkit for model inference.

(1) It was impossible to deploy to the web server due to the process flow,

(2) Lack of integration with Huggingface Transformers, which has now become the de facto standard for natural language processing tools. (DeepSpeed-Inference only supports 3 models)

(3) Also, since parallelization starts in the GPU state, there was a problem that all parameters of the model had to be put on the GPU before parallelization.

Parallelformers solved a number of problems in DeepSpeed-Inference. Using this toolkit internally, we were able to easily deploy a large model to our web server, reducing the cost of deployment by up to 3-5x. More detailed information and source code can be found on GitHub. Thanks !",1626580031.0

Note: *This is not exactly a Machine Learning project, but a tool that can be useful in many Machine Learning (NLP)  projects.*

Hey everyone,

I (along with 2 other people) made a project called **Newsemble**.      It is an API that allows for fast retrieval of current news (at the     moment, only Indian websites are supported, but we can add others if     anyone wants that). It's a REST API built using *Flask, MongoDB and BeautifulSoup*.      Due to some of the drawbacks of current news APIs (full content not     available, character limit, limited requests), we wanted to build  our    own as were looking to do news analysis.

We have made all the code open source. Please refer to the [medium blog](https://medium.com/@rg089/newsemble-3311d2dc9817) for further details and implementation of this API.

*This will be useful for news analysis, trend detection, keyword detection amongst other NLP tasks.*

*We are planning to release some NLP projects using this API very soon!*

***Most  importantly, if there are any additional features or extra news  sites    you want, or any other improvements in general, please do let  us  know. Thanks!🤝🏻***

If you found the project useful, please 👏 the article or 🌟 the repo. It really motivates us going forward!

I have read that in the field of operations research, there are methods from linear programming that can be used for scheduling tasks (e.g. which worker to assign to which machine), but these often require a predetermined cost matrix that details the relative advantage of having a particular worker assigned to a particular machine.

But is there anything in machine learning that tries to solve the ""prioritization task""? If 5 new jobs arrive, which job should be started first? 

Has anyone ever worked on something like that?

I wanted to access the latest and the greatest Nvidia GPU's and was wondering which cloud provider would be the cheapest?

In my search so far, I was able to find that Genesis Cloud provides you with Nvidia 3080 and Nvidia 3090, are there any other good cloud providers who provide the same GPU? which one would be the cheapest?
