Mt Gox doesn't execute trades very quickly, so we were  watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The  price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At  this point, I realized this wasn't merely a large seller willing to  accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by  selling a huge percentage of the market's total bitcoins at once.

I  had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account, from earlier sales I'd made.  I looked at the market stats, and realized that there were tons of  orders to buy BTC at $0.01 that would likely eat up any remaining  bitcoins this seller had on the order. I figured if I put a buy order in  for $0.0101, my order would execute first and I could buy a huge amount  of bitcoins from this seller before it hit the bottom. The only problem  was that Mt Gox was running slower than molasses at the time, and  everyone was saying that it wasn't accepting trades. I had to try  several times, but eventually I got a buy order in, offering to buy as  many bitcoins as I could for $0.0101.

The site stopped responding  completely for a while, probably from so many people hitting refresh to  see what was going on. When I got back in, I saw in my account:

06/19/11 17:51  Bought BTC  259684.77 for 0.0101

I  had just purchased over 250,000 bitcoins for $2613. At the trading  price immediately before this large sell order happened, that number  would have been worth nearly $5 million. After I regained my breath, I  tried to figure out what to do. I wasn't sure what was really going on.  Over the past few days there had been a lot of talk and complaints about  Mt Gox's security. Lists of Mt Gox usernames, email addresses and  encrypted passwords were being traded around, which was an obvious sign  that security at Mt Gox had been breached in some way. If there was an  attacker in the system, perhaps he was able to log into my account now  and force my account to execute some other crazy trade. ""

2. The way Bitcoin was created is almost as important as Bitcoin. Anonymous creator, no financial incentive, open-source for anyone to use, had $0 value for a year. It's like humans discovering gold for the first time

3. Any Bitcoin fork is a waste of time. Imagine if the creator of the universe could create a knock off gold at any time and put it in the ground for us. For value, we seek items that have rare properties. meanwhile Satoshi created the scarcest asset known to mankind.

4. Not even one of the largest countries could cripple Bitcoin. 

5. There's **way** smarter people than me that already understand this and are doing everything they can to accumulate as much as possible via manupulation. And they know there is a small time window to do this.  It feels like just yesterday I bought the dip at $3,000. This thing is going into the millions.

6. People that make fun of or disregard Bitcoin are completely wrong. There is no ""opinion"" on Bitcoin, it just exists as it was created to be.

7. Imagine being trapped in a reality where Infinite money printing exists and there is no way out. Utterly terrifying. Something like Bitcoin was inevitable.

I first told my dad (an older boomer) about crypto currencies in 2016. He thought they were full of shit, only used to buy dr\*gs on the internet, and for other illicit ventures. He wanted nothing to do with them.

Fast forward to 2021 and my dad is taking pain relief meds that you can't get in the US. Not that I condone any of it - but they make him feel better and he's tried just about every other option and is tired of seeing new doctors every week.

Yesterday, since his friend that he usually buys from is out of town, my dad managed to find what he was looking for online - but the only accepted payment was with BTC or LTC. So he calls me for help and within 5 minutes of sitting with him I've sent 12 LTC to a wallet, recieved a confirmation email on the purchase, and a shipping notification for when he can expect his order. (used LTC because no way was I giving up any of my BTC).

The look on his face was priceless and I've now set him up with a wallet of his own as well as taught him how to use the feautes, what different coins do, and how to check his transactions on the blockchain.

Things in my family have truly come full circle and i've been completely reassured that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.",1626697508.0

For example, the Lightning Network as secure off-chain settlement to solve Bitcoin's scaleability. Always sounded reasonable, but many, many years have passed since initial proposals and nothing ever seemed here or stable.

Someone tipped me with lnbot the other day for a comment posted, and I thought as knowledgable as I've been about bitcoin for a long time, I have no idea how to claim something that is legitimately built on the bitcoin network.

So I do a little investigating for a Lightning compatible wallet. Critical for me is:

* open source
* non-custodial

Came across the usual lists of recommended wallets and dug deeper into Muun.  I am blown away.  Not only does it meet those two criteria, it's just simple, fast, and does exactly what I didn't think would be possible with LN - it makes it so you *don't have to think about it*.

I click ""Receive"", I click ""Lightning"" and just like any bitcoin transaction, you get a QR code and I withdrew my sats from the lntipbot. That's cool and all but what's important is how can someone get their on-chain bitcoin onto Lightning, so it's ready for its actual use case of buying coffee and whatnot.  I have to set up a channel right? Or find someone to open a channel with? I have to manage how long the channel's open? Invoices? Eh? Bitcoin's simplicity vanishes... but no!

Muun's whole philosophy is you get **one** balance. So I hit ""Receive"", then ""Bitcoin"", then I send like $10 worth to it. Now suddenly, my Muun wallet has a balance of the tip from before and the btc I just sent, no distinction. I don't know what's on chain, off chain, but **it doesn't matter**! 

I then hit ""Send"", ""Lightning"" and deposit $5 into the Reddit lntipbot. It works! I definitely didn't have $5 of LN balance, but it sends instantly all the same.

*This is how it's meant to be.* The security, distributed protection, and rigid scarcity of Bitcoin, but versatility to handle microtransactions globally. The only reason bitcoin is not every country's default currency is people's ignorance and the intentional or unintentional misinformation spewed by those with power to lose. 

It's worked since 2008. It works even better now. The technology is here. You don't need complex custodial financial constructs like ETFs and derivatives to own it as an investment and you don't need 1,000s of other pointless cryptos to use it for small payments. Try Muun or some other Lightning wallet and start using it. This just feels game changing, and it shouldn't have taken me getting a Reddit tip to figure that out.",1626637268.0
