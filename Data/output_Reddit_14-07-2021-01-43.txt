NL-Augmenter\u00a0\ud83e\udd8e \u2192 \ud83d\udc0d is a part of the wider GEM benchmark, [GEM (Generation, Evaluation, Metrics)](https://gem-benchmark.com/nl_augmenter) workshop at ACL, 2021 and their future iterations.\n\nThe NL-Augmenter is a collaborative effort intended to add transformations of datasets dealing with natural language. Transformations augment text datasets in diverse ways, including: introducing spelling errors, randomizing names, and numbers, paraphrasing ... and whatever creative augmentation you contribute to the benchmark.\u00a0We invite submissions of transformations to this framework by way of GitHub pull request, through **July 25, 2021**.\u00a0**All submitters of accepted transformations (and filters) will be included as co-authors on a paper announcing this framework.**\n\nProject:\u00a0[https://github.com/GEM-benchmark/NL-Augmenter](https://github.com/GEM-benchmark/NL-Augmenter)\n\nWe\u00a0strongly believe that the benefits of open science should reach\u00a0everyone and hence we are making this effort to reach you. We also encourage you to share this with other researchers in\u00a0your department who\u00a0would benefit from\u00a0this open collaboration.
